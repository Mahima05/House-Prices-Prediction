# House Prices Prediction

This project involves predicting house prices using machine learning models. The goal is to accurately estimate the selling prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, and other attributes. The project leverages Python and popular machine learning libraries to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses raw housing data to make it suitable for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts and selects relevant features that contribute to the accuracy of the prediction.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes different machine learning algorithms to train models on the processed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of the models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy.
- **Prediction:** Generates price predictions for new or unseen data based on the trained models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computing library.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Ensure that you have the dataset in the appropriate format. The dataset should be placed in the project directory.
   
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook file (`House_Prices_Prediction.ipynb`) to execute the code step by step.
   - The notebook contains sections for data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

3. **Evaluate the Models:**
   - Experiment with different models and compare their performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), etc.

4. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices on new data.
